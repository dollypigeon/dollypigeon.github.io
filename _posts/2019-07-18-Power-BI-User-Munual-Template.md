As a Power BI dashboard creator and designer, I can create complicated dashboards with powerful features. But sometimes our clients, people who view and use our dashboards, might be confusing while viewing the dashboards. Therefore, I have created a Power BI Dashboard Navigation Overview for the end-users which is showing below.

This template is created based on the dashboards I have created. Hope it can give you an idea of how to write a user guide for your clients. If you need the original file, which is editable, you can email me at ila.li@outlook.com.
