In Power BI, when we have a bar chart displaying quite a long period of time like the chart below, it might be quite hard for user to read which bar is the start date of a month. Therefore, we can consider highlight the bar of the first date of each month with a different color to make the chart clearer and easier to read.  This article is explaining how we can achieve that.
