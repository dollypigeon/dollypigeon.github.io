Sometimes our data can have various data structures. For example, a company that has lots of sites may have more than one structure to group their sites. They may be group by regions and head offices while site is at the lowest level, regions and head offices are the highest level in their own structures. When we are creating the Power BI dashboards for that kind of data, we might need to have multiple slicers in order to view the dashboards in different structures. 

The easiest way is probably creating mutiple pages and put different slicer on each page. But if you already have multiple pages for different visualizations, it will be likely to make users feel confusing. In that case, we can use Bookmark to enable filtering with different slicers seperately in one page.
